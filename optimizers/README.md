This folder contains the source code for generating plots in the paper focused on the comparison
of optimizers.

The ``sim`` folder provides a comparison when using a simulator, and the ``hw`` folder provides a
comparison when using IBMQ. Inside both folders are Jupyter notebooks containing the numerics.
